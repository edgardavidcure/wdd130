                <h2 class="intro-title">A New Computer</h2>
                <p>Buying a new computer is one of the most important decisions a person can made nowadays. The need for technology to perform our daily tasks and be productive is bigger than ever before. Every person who has a responsiblilty of any kind, needs a computer to perform their tasks. From paying your bills, to renew your drivers license. From registering from college to complete our job applications, internet has become the main platform where we can all complete a task. With that being said, the question now is.. What is the right computer for me? There are many brands out there who offer different features on their computers, but ultimately, we want something reliable and easy to use. That is why I recommend the macbook guide to help you choose a reliable computer to help you get by. Let’s start reviewing some of the key aspects to make the right decision.</p>

                <h2>The Right Choice</h2>
                <p>How cool would it be to live a lifestyle where money was not the first thing to consider in order to make the right purchase? Would you choose the most expensive item out there? Well… Let me tell you something, regardless if money is an issue or not, choosing the right macbook is not necesarilly attached to the highest price tag out there. Isn’t it cool?! There are multiple options that range from the low $999 to the high +$3000 Dollars. But to understand why a Macbook can be so expensive or so cheap, we need to talk about two important topics that could be unknown for some of us, or maybe we have not come to understand completely. Those are: Macbook Models and Processors.</p>
