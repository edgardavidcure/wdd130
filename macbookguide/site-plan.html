        Buying a new computer is one of the most important decisions a person can made nowadays. The need for technology to perform our daily tasks and be productive is bigger than ever before. Every person who has a responsiblilty of any kind, needs a computer to perform their tasks. From paying your bills, to renew your drivers license. From registering from college to complete our job applications, internet has become the main platform where we can all complete a task. With that being said, the question now is.. What is the right computer for me? There are many brands out there who offer different features on their computers, but ultimately, we want something reliable and easy to use. That is why I recommend the macbook guide to help you choose a reliable computer to help you get by. Let’s start reviewing some of the key aspects to make the right decision.
        How cool would it be to live a lifestyle where money was not a problem to make the right purchase? Would you choose the most expensive item out there? Well… Let me tell you something, regardless if money is an issue or not, choosing the right macbook is not necesarilly attached to the highest price tag out there. Isn’t cool?! There are multiple options that range from $800 to +$3000 Dollars. But to understand why a Macbook can be so expensive or so cheap, we need to talk about two important topics that could be unknown for some of us, or maybe we have not come to understand completely. Those are: Macbook Models and Processors.

      <h3>Processors</h3>
      <p>
        Processors are the brain of a computer. They process all the computer information, files, data, programs and allow the computer to work. Without a processor, we would have a box with a screen, a keyboard and mousepad, that do not work or function together. Everytime you turn on your computer, a signal is sent to the processor who process some data and activates certain parts of the computer, like the screen, the keyboard, the lights, and others. Computer processors have been upgrading every year, allowing you to handle more and more programs at a faster speed every time. If you use your computer to only check your emails, to create programs, edit photos or play games, the processor will always be the key factor for how fast your tasks can be completed. If you currently have an old computer or if you have had a computer before, you might have noticed that everything you try to do on that computer runs slower than ever before. The reason why this happens is because technology is moving so fast that all of our files, documents and data are being upgraded to new technologies that require more space, more power, more everything. It might seem odd but it is the reality and the best way to know what processor is the right for you and what you do, is to understand the technology behind each. Let’s take a look: M1 Chip - M1 Pro - M1 Max - M1 Ultra - M2 chip

      <h3>Models</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever been at an Apple Store or at your local BestBuy, stand in front of the table where all computers are and randomly start looking at the price tags without having any idea of what to choose or what to do? I have, and that is why I want to help a little, so you can go to your nearest store and be able to know what are the different models and their features. First let me show you a list of all macbook models and a few pictures of each, to help you recognize how do they look like and what they offer. - Macbook Air 13.3” - Air 13.6” - Pro 14 and 16” - Pro 13.3”. Now that you know the difference on processors and what Macbook Models include them, let’s take a look at some features that can be beneficial for our intended use on the computer. Screen quality and size -  Fingerprint Reader - Battery Life - Ports - Weight - Touchbar - Type of charger - Camera quality - Storage space - RAM Memory
