    <p>Hello everyone! I am majoring in Web and computer programming with a bachelors degree in applied technology. I
        love to play soccer, read, and spend time with my wife. I am currently working in sales but I hope to learn a
        few more things that will allow me to start working in the computer science field.</p>
    <p>I think the web design field has so many opportunities to learn, progress and help others accomplish their
        dreams. Nowadays is almost necessary to use webpages for everything, and to learn about web design and
        development, it is a great opportunity for our personal lives.</p>
